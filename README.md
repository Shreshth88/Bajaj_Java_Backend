# ðŸ’¡ Follower Graph App â€“ Bajaj Finserv Health Challenge (SRM April 2025)

This Spring Boot application was developed for the **Bajaj Finserv Health Programming Challenge**.  
It automatically interacts with a remote API, solves a graph-based user follow problem based on the `regNo`, and submits the result to a secured webhook with JWT authentication.
